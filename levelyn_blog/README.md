# GitHub Pages Jekyll Blog Starter

This is a minimal Jekyll site that works on GitHub Pages with the built-in **minima** theme.

## Quick start

1. Create a new public repo named `<your-username>.github.io` on GitHub.
2. Download this ZIP, unzip it, and push these files to that repo.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will build automatically.
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io` in a minute or two.

## Writing posts

- Add Markdown files to `_posts` named like `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Include front matter at the top, e.g.:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "My First Post"
date: 2025-08-11 12:00:00 -0400
tags: [intro]
---
```

## Local preview (optional)

If you have Ruby installed:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
