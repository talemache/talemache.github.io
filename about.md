**Hi — I’m Ryan.**
I make music and software, and I’m still learning about life every day. I’m a husband and a dad, which means I spend a lot of time juggling family life with creative projects — and honestly, that balance has shaped a lot of who I am.

I’m passionate about the intersection of technology, music, and creativity. To me, they all go hand in hand.

## What I Do
- **Music Production:** I create all kinds of music and experiment with sound design. Eventually, I’ll share some of that here.
- **Software Development:** I’ve built a lot of things with code. It’s one of the few things I can dive into from morning until night and completely lose track of time.
- **Learning**: Whether it’s technical, creative, or just life in general, I’m always trying to expand what I know — and hopefully get a little better along the way.

## This Blog
This is my space to share thoughts on music production, software development, personal growth, and the lessons I’m picking up as I go. It’s built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.
