Hiâ€”I'm Ryan. I make music and software. Still learning about life every day.

I'm passionate about the intersection of technology, music, and creativity, they really go hand in hand.

## What I Do

- **Music Production**: I create all types of music and experiment with sound design. I'll eventually show some of that off.
- **Software Development**: I've built a lot of things with code and software. It's one of the only things I can do from morning to night with very little breaks.
- **Learning**: Continuously expanding my knowledge in both technical, creative domains, and quite frankly, life.

## This Blog

This space is where I share thoughts on music production, software development, personal growth, and the lessons I'm learning along the way. It's built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
