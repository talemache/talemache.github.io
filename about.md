Hiâ€”I'm Ryan. I make music and software. Still learning about life every day.

I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and creativity, exploring how code can enhance musical expression and how music can inspire better software design.

## What I Do

- **Music Production**: Creating electronic music and experimenting with sound design
- **Software Development**: Building tools and applications that solve real problems
- **Learning**: Continuously expanding my knowledge in both technical and creative domains

## This Blog

This space is where I share thoughts on music production, software development, personal growth, and the lessons I'm learning along the way. It's built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
