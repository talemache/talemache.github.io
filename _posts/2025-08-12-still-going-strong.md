I ended up working well into the next day on this blog setup, and I have to get up for work in a couple of hours. It's been a while since I was this excited to do something that involved computers after working hours.
The whole process turned out to be more engaging than I expected. Setting up Jekyll, connecting it to GitHub Pages, and getting the domain from Namecheap to actually point to the right place had just enough technical challenges to keep me interested. Using AI to help speed up the creation process made a huge difference too - it handled a lot of the repetitive setup work and helped me troubleshoot issues that would have taken me much longer to figure out on my own.
I often get really excited at the beginning of something but eventually drop it over time. There's something different about this though. Maybe it's because I created this blog completely from scratch rather than just using a template or existing platform. There's a satisfaction in having every piece of it set up exactly how I want it.
Hopefully I can keep this momentum going. The foundation is solid now, so adding content should be the easier part. We'll see if I'm still writing posts in a few months or if this joins the pile of abandoned side projects.
