# Finding My Stride Again: Training for a Half-Marathon  
It’s been almost 10 years since I last ran a half-marathon — and this coming Sunday, I’m finally doing it again.  

To be honest, the thought of running that far again scared me at first. Over time, I fell out of shape, and the idea of pushing my body like that felt like a really bad idea. But little by little, I’ve been putting in the work. I’ve been running more, making better choices, and trying to set myself up mentally and physically to stay active for as long as I can.

## Why It Matters  
Running has always been a big part of my life. For me, working out isn’t just about the physical side — it’s about mental health, too. Getting that peace back, mile by mile, has reminded me why it was so important in the first place.  

This half-marathon feels less like a race and more like a reset. It’s a way of proving to myself that I can still do this, even after time away. And beyond that, it’s about building habits that help me stay healthy, prevent disease, and keep me moving for the people who matter most in my life.  

## Looking Ahead  
I don’t know what the clock will say at the finish line — but I'm just glad to be running to something and not away from it. The point is that I’ll be out there again, taking it one step at a time, and finding my way back to something that’s always been a part of me.  

*So here’s to Sunday and running for me again*
