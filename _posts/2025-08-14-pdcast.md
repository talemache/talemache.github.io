Here Goes Nothing (And Everything): Why I'm Restarting My Podcast
Sometimes the universe has a funny way of nudging you toward something you thought you'd buried forever.
A few weeks ago, I was digging through some old files on my computer – you know, that digital archaeology we all do when we're procrastinating on something else – and I stumbled across something I thought was gone forever. A single episode from a podcast I started back in 2013 or 2014.
I'd completely forgotten it existed.
The Ghost of Podcasts Past
Back then, I was in a very different place. I started that podcast with all the enthusiasm of someone who had no idea what they were doing, recorded a handful of episodes, and then... got scared. Really scared. The kind of scared that makes you delete everything and pretend it never happened because what if someone you knew found it? What if they judged you? What if you weren't good enough, smart enough, interesting enough?
So I nuked it all. Every episode, every trace. Or so I thought.
But there it was, this lone survivor sitting in a forgotten folder, like a message from my past self saying, "Hey, remember when you wanted to try this?"
Why Now Is Different
Here's the thing: I'm in a much better place now than I was back then. Not perfect – let's be real, who is? – but more grounded. More okay with the messiness of figuring things out in public. More ready to accept myself, flaws and false starts and all.
I think that's what this podcast is really about for me. It's not about having all the answers or being particularly wise or entertaining (though if those happen, bonus). It's about giving myself permission to exist out loud, to work through things as they come, to be imperfect and still worth listening to.
Maybe that sounds self-indulgent, but I don't think it is. I think there's something powerful about watching someone – anyone – try to be authentically themselves, especially when they don't have it all figured out. We're all just making it up as we go along, but we so rarely admit that.
The Unraveling Project
I'm calling this my "unraveling project" – not in a falling-apart way, but in an untangling way. All these years, I've been carrying around these ideas about who I should be, what I should want, how I should sound, what I should care about. This podcast feels like a chance to pull at those threads and see what's actually underneath.
Maybe I'll discover I'm not who I thought I was. Maybe I'll find patterns I didn't know existed. Maybe I'll work through stuff that's been holding me back without even realizing it. Or maybe I'll just ramble about whatever weird project I'm obsessing over that week. Honestly, all of those outcomes sound pretty good to me.
The Ripple Effect
But here's what really gets me excited: maybe someone else will hear this and think, "Oh, I'm not the only one who doesn't have it all figured out." Maybe someone will decide to restart their own abandoned project, or finally try that thing they've been putting off, or just feel a little less alone in the beautiful mess of being human.
If this podcast helps even one person give themselves permission to be imperfect and still worthy of taking up space, then every awkward pause and rambling tangent will have been worth it.
Episode 0: Where It All Begins (Again)
I'm starting with that rediscovered episode as Episode 0. It feels right – beginning again exactly where I left off, but as a different person. A time capsule meeting a fresh start. The scared version of me talking to the version who's ready to try again.
I have no idea where this is going. I don't have a content calendar or a brand strategy or a clear vision of what this becomes. I just have curiosity, a decent microphone, and the hard-won knowledge that the things we're most afraid to share are often the things people most need to hear.
So here goes nothing. And everything.

You can find the podcast everywhere you listen to podcast (I think at least). Come figure this out with me.
