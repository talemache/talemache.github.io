# Here Goes Nothing (And Everything): Why I'm Restarting My Podcast
Sometimes the universe has a funny way of nudging you toward something you thought you'd buried forever.

A few weeks ago, I was digging through some old files on my computer and I stumbled across a single episode from a podcast I started back in 2013 or 2014.

*I'd completely forgotten it existed.*

And I had alot of enthusiasm, but over time that would wane and I would delete everything for one of the most ridiculous reasons ever: 

*I didn't want anyone I knew to find it.* 

Really not the best idea looking back because I had put a ton of work into it, let alone money which we didn't have a lot of during that time period.

Now that I'm in a much better place, and less self-conscience about what others think, I really want to get this going again to help myself and others accept what we are.

## Episode 0: Where It All Begins (Again)
I'm starting with that rediscovered episode as Episode 0. It feels right â€“ beginning again exactly where I left off, but as a different person. It's almost like listenin to a completely different person.

Alright, that's it for now. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and go check it wherever you listen to podcasts.
