# Here Goes Nothing (And Everything): Why I’m Restarting My Podcast
Sometimes the universe has a funny way of nudging you back to something you thought you’d left behind.

A few weeks ago, I was digging through some old files and found a single surviving episode from a podcast I started back in 2013 or 2014.

*I had completely forgotten it existed.*

Back then, I had a ton of enthusiasm — but it didn’t last. Eventually, I deleted everything for one of the most ridiculous reasons:

*I didn’t want anyone I knew to find it.*

Looking back, it wasn’t the smartest move. I’d poured hours of work into it (and even money we really didn’t have at the time). But fear won out, and I let it all go.

Now, I’m in a different place. I care a lot less about what other people might think, and I care more about doing things that matter to me. Restarting this podcast feels like the right step — not just for myself, but maybe for anyone else who’s learning to accept who they are, too.

## Episode 0: Where It All Begins (Again)
So here we are. I’m kicking things off with that rediscovered episode as Episode 0. It feels right — beginning again exactly where I left off, only this time as a different person. Honestly, listening to it now feels like hearing from a stranger, but in the best possible way.

That’s it for now. If you made it this far, thanks for reading — and go check it out wherever you listen to podcasts.
